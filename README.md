A/B Testing Analysis (Synthetic Data)

This repository contains an A/B Testing project that analyzes the effectiveness of different versions of a product/website feature using synthetic data. The goal is to simulate real-world A/B testing experiments and evaluate the impact of changes through statistical methods. The project was built in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

Project Overview
We generated synthetic data for a control group (A) and a treatment group (B) to simulate real-world A/B testing. The analysis involved:

Data generation using statistical methods.
Hypothesis testing to assess statistical significance.
Visualization of results to evaluate performance between the two groups.


How to Use

To get started:

Open the project in Google Colab by following this link.

Make a copy of the Colab notebook by going to File > Save a copy in Drive.
All necessary packages (pandas, scipy, matplotlib) can be installed within Colab if needed by using the !pip install commands.
Data
The project uses synthetically generated data for:

Control Group (A): Baseline product version.
Treatment Group (B): Modified product version.

Key metrics analyzed:

Conversion rate
Click-through rate
Session duration

Results include insights on whether the treatment version outperforms the control version based on statistical significance and confidence intervals.
